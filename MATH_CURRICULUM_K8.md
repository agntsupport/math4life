# Math4Life - Curriculum K-8 Based on Common Core Standards

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive mathematics curriculum progression from Kindergarten through Grade 8, aligned with Common Core State Standards. The curriculum focuses on building deep mathematical understanding through carefully sequenced learning progressions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Focus
Instruction should focus deeply on concepts emphasized in the standards to ensure students gain:
- Strong foundational conceptual understanding
- High degree of procedural skill and fluency
- Ability to apply mathematics to solve real-world problems

### 2. Coherence
Mathematical connections that knit topics together within and across grade levels, supporting vertical progression of knowledge, skill, and sophistication.

### 3. Rigor
Balance of conceptual understanding, procedural skill/fluency, and application.

## Standards for Mathematical Practice (All Grades)

These "habits of mind" should be developed at all levels:

1. **Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them**
2. **Reason abstractly and quantitatively**
3. **Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others**
4. **Model with mathematics**
5. **Use appropriate tools strategically**
6. **Attend to precision**
7. **Look for and make use of structure**
8. **Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning**
